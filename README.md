# Simple-Computer-Vision-Project

## Overview
I created this repository to put the programs I am learning and implementing in computer vision

### Find and Draw Contours Using OpenCV
Contours can be explained simply as a curve joining all the continuous points (along the boundary), having the same color or intensity. The contours are useful for shape analysis, object detection, and recognition.
so in the code, I learned how to find and draw contours using OpenCV.

### Motion Detection and Tracking Using OpenCV
This code can detect motion by calculating the absolute difference between frames then applying a threshold and dilating to help us locate the contours finally we draw contours on the moving objects.

### Detect, Track, and Count Car and Moto in Video Using OpenCV
This code can detect objects by applying Background Subtraction and track them by using a `tracker` package then applying a threshold to help us locate the contours finally we draw contours on the moving objects.

### Vehicle Detection and Counting Using OpenCV
This code can detect vehicles by applying Background Subtraction and counting it by drawing a line and if the vehicle passes the line the counter will increase.
